## Colton Ensz
###  Mini-Project-4
This mini project is a blog website based off of the django tutorial from https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/intro/tutorial01/.

My project is meant to be a one way blog, where only the admin, me, can make blog posts, but you still have to register to see them.

### Gettings Started  
Users should run the command **pip install -r requirments.txt** to install all needed packages

Users should then run the code **python manage.py makemigrations** to create the SQL entries

Users should then run the code **python manage.py migrate** to apply the migrations

Users should then run the code **python manage.py createsuperuser** to create a superuser if they want to post too!

Finally to run the code locally users need to run the code **py manage.py runserver** users should then be running the project
